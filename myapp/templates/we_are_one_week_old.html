    <h1>We are one week old!!!</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <div> Today is a week since Golden Hex was reborn. March 8th. International Women's Day.
            Since March 1st first day of opening, life at our store was booming. Many friends came by.
            Many customers were excited to find their favorite products. Interesting people shared their personal
            stories. We loved it!It was a very delightful, busy and fun beginning of the week. Until the days when
            shelves with some products were ... completely empty. We warned our customers ahead of time
            so they wonâ€™t drive a distance

            a March 8th, International Women's Day, They pleasantly surprised our customers!

        <div> We also started a new program: <b>SURPRISE ME.</b> So if you have someone whom you would like to
            pleasantly
            surprise, you can purchase from Golden Hex a box of chocolate (or other products of your choice) and
            tell us how to contact that person (recipient). One of us at Golden Hex will get in touch with your
            recipient informing them that something special is waiting their pick up in the Golden Hex store.
            Small greeting card will be added to the gift with your desired message. There is no extra charge here
            - you can pay via papal or stop in the store to purchase your gift ahead of time. We will inform you when
            gift is picked up and probably make a picture, if one of us is available.
            To order a <b>SURPRISE ME</b> gift please contact Lilia (at) goldenhex (dot) com.
